Here is the website that only works locally because my ngnix does not work. I tried to implement a backgorund picture that I generated with
AI, but I didn't like how it looked. So, I kept it simple and also if you hover over the buttons they are responsive. Here is the website with AI image:<img width="1129" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-20 at 7 11 11 AM" src="https://github.com/SaparShayanov/roomateharmony/assets/144827052/1899acff-47bb-4b07-916f-ac37fdfc6d2c">
And here is the final result:

I dont know why my spotify login is not working. Whenever I press login with spotify it takes me to this page: <img width="1725" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-20 at 7 01 28 AM" src="https://github.com/SaparShayanov/roomateharmony/assets/144827052/f7ae241c-e41b-414a-90ae-0cbf942798d4">
I clik agree and it gives me this error: <img width="1725" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-20 at 7 01 39 AM" src="https://github.com/SaparShayanov/roomateharmony/assets/144827052/c0fdf4c3-8c25-4982-8881-c1b83618bca3">
This is not the only error it would give me. I got rid of it at first, but then after I click on agree it would take me back to the website
and wouldn't show anything. I think the problem is the way I am getting the api and posting it.

The recipe api worked well. I used SPOONACULAR API for recipes and it worked well. I had issues same as spotify api with the way I was getting the information
but I resolved it and here are the results: <img width="1724" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-20 at 7 02 11 AM" src="https://github.com/SaparShayanov/roomateharmony/assets/144827052/dea3b60a-eeba-4eff-a1b5-fec56f6dcba5">

It generates random recipe and shows the information about it.

I also implemented socketIO for real time communication. It works from one user but I have not tried it with multiple because I tried to implement MangoDB to store data and etc. But it didn't work. It was diffucult to install
and properly run it.<img width="1725" alt="Screen Shot 2023-11-20 at 7 02 41 AM" src="https://github.com/SaparShayanov/roomateharmony/assets/144827052/72c7e537-d81f-412d-8162-635c064c591e">
